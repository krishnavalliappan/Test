<h1><b>1</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> 1-Page Summary </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Do you feel like you’re always playing catch up with your to-do list? Are there never enough hours in the day?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Getting Things Done (GTD) program is designed to help you do the things you <i>have </i>to do with less time, energy, and effort so you can do more of the things you <i>want</i> to do.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The crux of the GTD system is to </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">store every task, reminder, and note bouncing around your brain in an external organization system to free up your mental energy to actually focus on the task at hand</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">. Your brain is great at creating and processing things but not at remembering them, so trying to keep track of everything in your head saps your brainpower from doing what your mind does best.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Through the GTD system, you’ll capture every task and reminder on lists, in files, and on your calendar. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You’ll be aware and in control of your entire workload so you can be fully present in each moment without the nagging feeling that you should be doing something else. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The five steps of the GTD system are:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Capture </span></b>all the problems and ideas that are taking your attention.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clarify </span></b>what each one means and what you need to do about it.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Organize </span></b>the decisions and actions you’ve clarified.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reflect </span></b>on everything in front of you to choose what to tackle next.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Engage </span></b>with the task (get it done).</div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you first start out, you’ll have a large mental backlog of items to capture and process, and this will take a good amount of time. After you get through it once, you’ll have all the items in the proper place. Then, on a regular basis (for example, daily), you’ll step through the five steps to capture and process new items, then figure out what you want to do that day.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 1: Capture</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The first step is to capture every idea, reminder, and piece of information and get it out of your head. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Capture <i>everything—</i>big and small, short-term and long-term, anything in your life that you feel should be different and that you have some motivation or commitment to change </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">(anything from career strategy ideas to a reminder to fix that gadget in your junk drawer).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you make a habit of capturing everything, you can trust that nothing will fall through the cracks. Other people will see your diligence and their trust in you will grow; furthermore, your trust in <i>yourself</i> and your confidence to accomplish things will grow.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Go through your desk, kitchen table, briefcase, and every other nook and cranny that could hold a note or reminder you need to process. Then wrack your brain for every other idea and loose end that’s nagging at you—whether it’s about a meeting you just had or a gift for your mom’s birthday next week.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Put everything in your in-tray. Don’t stop to work on anything else—just</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> focus on capturing absolutely everything as quickly as possible. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you’re done, you’ll take time to assess every item.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 2: Clarify</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The next step is to </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">decide the intended outcome for each item and figure out what the immediate next action is to make progress toward that outcome.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> The “next action” is the immediate next physical step you can take toward a project’s completion. For example, if the item says “schedule meeting,” you need to decide what you need to do next to schedule that meeting: Check your availability? Book a conference room? Email meeting requests?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">This front-end decision-making boosts your productivity because it forces you to determine how to tackle an item when it lands in front of you rather than waiting until you’re up against a deadline. Clarifying next actions </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">turns seemingly daunting tasks into bite-sized actions</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> you can easily complete and feel success with.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Based on the next action you determine for each item, you’ll either:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Throw it away.</span></b> If it doesn’t require any action and you won’t need the information later, toss it. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keep it for your reference files.</span></b> These items don’t require any action, but they have information that may be useful later.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Do it.</span></b> If the next action takes less than two minutes, do it now.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Label it a project.</span></b> The GTD system defines projects as anything that requires more than one step and can be finished within a year—anything from planting your garden to learning new software at work. Put a sticky note on it labeling it a project and put it in a Pending pile. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Decide to delegate it. </span></b>If the next action will take longer than two minutes, consider whether you’re the best person for the job. If not, put a sticky note on it marking that you’re delegating it and to whom, and put it in the Pending pile. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Save it for later.</span></b> Label items that don’t require any action now but you might want to follow up on in the future as “Someday/Maybe.” If you want to create a reminder to reconsider it on a specific date, make a note of that date so you can put it in your tickler file or on your calendar in the next step. Put all these items in the Pending pile. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Defer to next actions. </span></b>If it’ll take longer than two minutes and you can’t delegate it, label it “Next Action” and put it in the Pending pile. </div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here’s a flowchart that shows Steps 1 to 3 more clearly:</span></div><div><br></div><img data-nimbus-attachment-global-id="w2RRpnBrTBWfJ9WY" data-nimbus-file-name="getting-things-done-flowchart.jpg" original-width="1143" original-height="1043" src="./assets/w2RRpnBrTBWfJ9WY.jpg" style="--en-naturalWidth:1143; --en-naturalHeight:1043;"><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 3: Organize</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the clarifying step, you made a decision about the next step for each item; now you’re going to organize the items into files, lists, and calendar items.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The author proposes a lot of different lists and files with different purposes, and it can be overwhelming. For now, focus on the big picture point—</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">that each item gets put into its ideal place, which gives you mental confidence that you’ve accounted for everything on your plate, and that it’ll be there when you need it</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Although you threw away some items during Step 2, you might still come across items that, upon further consideration, you decide you don’t need. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Trash them.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now take the non-actionable reference items—whether they’re menus from your favorite food delivery spot or a list of contacts for members of the committee you chair—and make your reference files. There are </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">two types of reference files</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">: subject-specific files for one type of document, such as past contracts you may need for future reference, and general-reference files for anything that doesn’t fall into a specific category.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In order for your reference files to be useful, your organization must be simple and easily navigable. An effective filing system motivates you to keep up with filing new items and makes it easy to retrieve documents when you need them.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now tackle the </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Pending pile</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">. Based on what you decided in the last step, put each item in one of the following places:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Projects list</span></b> is an index of your projects that are in the planning process, which helps you keep track of each project’s finish line and consistently determine each project’s next action. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Project Support Materials file</span></b> holds project plans, research, invoices, and other documents.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Waiting For list</span></b> helps you keep track of tasks you’re waiting for someone else to complete or items you’ve decided to delegate.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Someday/Maybe list </span></b>is a running list of things you want to act on in the future. You must review this list regularly so you can decide when the time is right to pursue one of these ideas. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Tickler file </span></b>(meant to tickle your memory) is a filing system that holds information, documents, and reminders you won’t need until a certain point in the future, such as a flyer for a play that doesn’t debut for another three months.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Calendar</span></b> is for items that need to be done at a certain time or on a certain day, such as appointments, deadlines, or reminders. The only items that should go on your calendar are things that must happen on that day or not at all. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Next Actions list</span></b> is a to-do list to be tackled as soon as possible; it’s essentially the catch-all for tasks that are actionable, take longer than two minutes, and can’t be delegated. If you have more than a few dozen next actions on this list, it helps to divide them up into categories based on what you need or where you need to be to tackle them, such as “Calls to Make” or “Office.”</div></li></ol><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 4: Reflect</span></span></h3><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Regularly reflect on all your lists and files to help you make smarter choices about which tasks to tackle. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Review your calendar daily and your Next Actions list frequently, so you always know the immovable aspects of your schedule—like meetings and appointments—as well as what needs to get done when you have time available.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The fast pace of life and incoming items makes it nearly impossible to keep your system completely updated on a day-to-day basis, so a Weekly Review is critical for keeping your lists and files clean and current. During the Weekly Review, you’ll:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Review your Projects, Project Plans, Next Actions, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe lists, and your Tickler File</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Capture anything you haven’t captured yet</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clarify any items that you haven’t clarified</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Take stock of your whole organization system to make sure everything is running smoothly </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Update your lists</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clean up and clear things out where needed</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In addition to catching up, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">your Weekly Review is a chance for you to ponder big-picture ideas and projects and consider whether your day-to-day obligations align with your goals and values in life.</span></b></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 5: Engage</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Getting Things Done system is designed to help you make informed choices about how you engage with your tasks, meaning what you do when you have time available. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can only feel confident about what you’re <i>doing</i> if you also feel confident about what you’re <i>not doing</i> at any given moment.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now that you have a list of Next Actions to do, you need to choose what to work on today, in which order. Use the following three models for choosing which item on your Next Actions list to tackle.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The Four-Criteria Model: Narrow Your Options</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">This model helps you narrow down your choices based on four criteria:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Context</span></b>: Certain tasks require you to be at a certain location or to have access to a certain tool (e.g. at the office or in front of a computer). It helps if you’ve already sorted your next actions into context-specific lists. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Time available</span></b>: Some tasks require an hour of focused attention, so if you just have a few minutes before your next appointment this isn’t the time for that task. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Energy available</span></b>: Certain tasks require a lot of mental or physical energy, while others don’t need much. Only tackle what you have the energy to take on. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Priority</span></b>: After narrowing down your options with the first three criteria, prioritizing will be a more subjective decision based on your intuition and judgment. Use the next two models to help you choose by determining first what category of work an item falls into and then how it fits into your big-picture goals and values. </div></li></ol><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The Threefold Model: Types of Work</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">To make an informed decision about whether to take on a task, you must understand which of the three categories it falls into:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Predefined work</span></b> is essentially anything on your Next Actions list and calendar, all of which you’ve clarified and deemed important. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Work that shows up </span></b>encompasses the unanticipated tasks that arise during the day, whether it’s a last-minute report your boss assigns you or the surprise repair your car needs. Prioritize this work when it needs your immediate attention, but don’t fall into the trap of defaulting to what’s right in front of you when it’s not the most important or urgent. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Defining work </span></b>is the time you spend maintaining the GTD system—clearing your in-tray, clarifying tasks, organizing, filing, and doing two-minute actions. You must prioritize time to do this regularly, ideally during your Weekly Review. </div></li></ol><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The Six-Level Model: Determine Priorities</span></span></b></h4><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">In order to prioritize the options in front of you, you need to have a context for how they fit into the bigger picture of your life and priorities.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> There are six different levels—or horizons—of perspectives to determine your priorities:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ground is the current action </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">on your Next Actions list. (Example: You have a phone call to make for work.)</span></div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 1 is current projects </span></b>with relatively short-term timelines. (Example: The phone call is about a deal you’re trying to make.)</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 2 is areas of focus and accountabilities</span></b>, or the roles and responsibilities you have, from job duties to maintaining your health and family commitments. This horizon doesn’t consist of tasks but rather the interests and responsibilities that help to determine what projects and actions you’ll take on. (Example: This deal would increase the company’s sales.) </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 3 is goals</span></b>—specifically, horizon 3 encompasses goals for the next one to two years. (Example: Making the deal would earn you major points with your boss.)</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 4 is vision</span></b>, or your goals for the next three to five years. (Example: This success would likely lead to a promotion.)</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 5 is purpose and principles</span></b>; this is the big-picture context of your life. All your actions, projects, focuses, goals, and visions are defined by and also lead you toward your purpose and principles. (Example: A promotion will put you in a position that allows you to have the career and lifestyle you want.)</div></li></ol><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Use the Natural Planning Method to Plan Projects</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Always have a next action identified for each project you have, so that you’re constantly making progress on your projects. Determining next actions on big projects can be daunting, but simply follow the same process you’d use if you were planning something in your daily life, like a birthday dinner with friends.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">This approach is called the Natural Planning Method, and it consists of these steps:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Define your purpose and principles. </span></b>Your purpose is the intention of the project, and your principles create the boundaries. If you’re planning a birthday dinner, your purpose is to celebrate and the boundaries could be factors like how affordable you want the restaurant to be. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Envision your outcome.</span></b> Your purpose is your <span style="font-family: inherit;"><i>why</i></span>, while your outcome is the <span style="font-family: inherit;"><i>what</i></span>: What will a successful outcome look, feel, and sound like? You might imagine your dinner happening around a big outdoor table, with all your friends laughing and sharing food. When you picture something and focus on it, it helps you create it and makes you more excited to achieve it. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Brainstorm. </span></b>This is the <span style="font-family: inherit;"><i>how</i></span>. Your brain naturally wants to fill in the gaps to determine how to make your vision a reality. During this stage, you might question whether the restaurant is open today, what time you need to go, and whether there’s gas in the car. Use mind maps or other brainstorming techniques to jot down as many ideas as you can without judging or criticizing the ideas along the way. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Organize.</span></b> This is the step when you organize all the random thoughts, questions, and ideas from the brainstorming process. You’ll naturally organize them based on logistics, priorities, and what needs to happen first: Call the restaurant to see if it’s open and make a reservation, then invite the guests, then get yourself dressed and ready to go. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Determine your next actions.</span></b> Determine what can actually be done now, and who’s going to do it. For dinner, your next action is to call the restaurant. </div></li></ol><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Implementing and mastering the GTD system is a lifelong process that helps you manage your day-to-day obligations while keeping your larger goals in mind. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">First, master the principles and practices, cement them as habits, and gain control of your daily tasks. Once you reach this point, take a bigger-picture approach to managing and organizing your life; proactively initiate projects to improve areas of your life. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ultimately, you can leverage the GTD system to implement new habits, tackle bucket-list aspirations, and create the lifestyle you want. </span></b></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>2</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Introduction: The Getting Things Done (GTD) Program </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Getting Things Done (GTD) program is designed to increase your productivity and effectiveness—not so you can squeeze even <i>more</i> into your already busy life, but so that you can do things with less time, energy, and effort. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you feel in control of your life and your to-do list, you can be present in each moment without the nagging feeling that there’s something else you should be doing. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">When your mind is clear, you can focus and use your creative energy for the task at hand, and in your free moments, you can fully enjoy life without feeling guilty that you’re not doing something “productive.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The GTD program is meant to be a lifelong practice, and you’ll continually graduate to more advanced levels of application. As you start to cement the strategies as habits, you’ll reach new levels of mastery to enhance your life and productivity in new ways: Once staying on top of your emails is second nature, use your skills (and newfound free time and energy) to take on a new hobby or strengthen your important relationships.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the meantime, don’t wait until you finish the book to start using the strategies—put them into practice as you go. Practicing the skills will give you a richer understanding and help you dive deeper into the program.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Many readers regularly re-read this book and come away with something new each time. The program requires more habit changes than most people can fully implement all at once, so readers tend to absorb pieces at a time; after the first time through, start practicing the basics, and the next time you’ll better understand the strategies for refining those basic skills. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Each time you read the book, you gain a new level of understanding and practice. </span></b></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Revised Edition Of The Book: New World, Same Program</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">This book has been revised and updated from its original 2001 edition. The principles and general strategies remain the same, but the world is a different place than it was at the turn of the century, so the author has made the following adjustments and additions:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">He incorporates the rise of digital technology and the ubiquity of apps designed to help you organize and schedule your life. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">The digital world compounds the problem of being overloaded with tasks and information while also offering more tools to deal with it. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">The author doesn’t list any specific apps or software, but he builds more flexibility into his advice about organizing with paper and digital tools. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">He addresses a broader audience of people seeking help organizing their lives. The original version was geared more toward executives and professionals. The revised version acknowledges that <i>everyone</i> is overloaded with tasks and information—in large part because we’re living simultaneously in the real and digital worlds—and needs help gaining control of life’s many demands. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">He takes a gentler approach to instructing readers on how to implement the program. Some readers of the original version felt that the GTD program was too overwhelming to take on; while the author doesn’t remove anything from the program, he emphasizes the fact that implementing it will be a long-term process, and that any pieces of the program you can put into practice will be helpful. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">He adds </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">cognitive research that affirms the validity of the GTD approach.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Much of this evidence didn’t exist when the original was published, but studies have since proven his claims. </span></div></li></ul><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>3</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Part 1 | Chapter 1: Your Organization System Must Fit Your Life </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">What does your to-do list look like? Is it a hodgepodge of reminders, information, and projects from all areas of your life? Are you getting anxious just thinking about it?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In this chapter, we’ll talk about why your current system isn’t working and how the Getting Things Done program takes a different approach.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Outdated Time Management Tools Can’t Keep Up With Today’s Demands</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Significant changes to daily life in the last half-century have overloaded people with work and personal responsibilities, so people need a more dynamic way of managing it all.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">First, most people’s jobs are no longer restricted to the hours of 9 am to 5 pm nor to the confines of the office. These days, people are always on call via phone and email, and the effects of globalization mean you could be working with people nine time zones away. There are no boundaries to your workday, so it easily steals time from other parts of your life.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Second, the nature of work has changed from more industrial, assembly-line type work with clear, visible tasks to so-called knowledge work with much more ambiguously defined projects. Previously, you knew what your task was (for example, assemble these parts) and you knew when it was done. Now, one task can eat up a lot of your time because there’s no clear signal when you’re done.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Third, modern life requires near-constant communication with more people. Most organizations require increasing interdepartmental collaboration, so workers are no longer limited to their specifically defined roles and departments. In your personal life, too, there’s more pressure to stay connected with friends and family via the Internet and social media.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">People have no clear boundaries to work and personal commitments, leaving them with little to no free time—or making them feel guilty or pulled in other directions when they do carve out free time.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Established time management tools were developed to organize life the way it <i>used</i> to be.</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Calendars are only effective at organizing a portion of your life. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">To-do lists and prioritizing strategies can’t keep up with the high volume and wide range of tasks most people have. </span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You need a system that can accommodate today’s faster pace of life and the information that comes from all directions.</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> A modern organization system needs to incorporate minuscule daily tasks as well as big-picture goals, and it needs to be simple enough to save more time and energy than it requires</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Organize Your Life From the Bottom-Up</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Many organizational systems promote organizing your life from the top-down, first determining your goals and values, then breaking that down into the projects and tasks that fall in line with them.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">However, a top-down approach often leads to three problems:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can easily get too distracted by urgent demands to even stop and think about your big-picture goals. </span></div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You may be so overwhelmed by your day-to-day demands that the thought of incorporating big-picture goals is daunting and stressful.</span></b></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your big-picture goals and values are likely to raise more tasks and to-dos, which adds to your overloaded schedule instead of clarifying and culling it.</span></div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Instead, the bottom-up approach that the GTD program promotes is more feasible:</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Once you have a system to keep your small-scale tasks under control, it’ll free up your energy, focus, and creativity to consider larger goals.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Additionally, big-picture goals will inevitably break down into smaller action steps, which will be easier to tackle if you already have a system in place.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Horizontal vs. Vertical Control</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">There are two ways to manage your commitments and actions:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizontal control takes stock of your projects and tasks in all areas of your life</span></b>—from getting your car repaired to finishing a report for work. This requires an organized system that can keep track of everything, helps you call up relevant reminders and information when you need it, and lets you switch your focus quickly and easily.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Vertical control goes into the details of one specific project or topic. </span></b>This might be all the details, research, and planning you need to do for a work report or home addition. Vertical control requires a system that lets you organize and easily access plans, notes, and reminders about this one topic. </div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">GTD is designed to accommodate both management systems because life requires both horizontal and vertical planning.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Manage Your Actions</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Most to-do lists are made up of “stuff”—plans and commitments that you haven’t yet broken down into actionable steps. Lists full of stuff are ineffective and overwhelming.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">An effective productivity system doesn’t manage your time, information, or priorities; it manages your <i>actions. </i></span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><i>The GTD program teaches you how to take this stuff, give it meaning, and turn it into “next action” steps</i></span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> using three objectives:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Have a trusted external system (outside your memory) to capture <i>everything</i> you must do, might need to do, or might need later.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Be decisive about all your tasks and commitments and have a running to-do list of next actions.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Organize all of the information and to-dos into appropriate categories and contexts.</span></div></li></ol><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you have an organized external system of actionable items and trusted reminders, your brain doesn’t have to juggle all these thoughts and information</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">—which is good because your brain doesn’t do a great job of it anyway.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Research shows that your brain can’t help but continually remind you about all the things you have to do, which is more of a distraction from your current task than a motivator to accomplish those pending tasks. How often do you think of something you need to do at random times when you can do nothing about it? Not only is it ineffective, but it adds to your stress and anxiety about all the things you need to do.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">An Effective System Calms and Clears Your Mind</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you throw a pebble into a still pond, how does the water react? Its reaction is directly proportional to the size of the pebble and the force of your throw—the water doesn’t overreact or underreact.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">An effective productivity system makes your mind like water, reacting in direct proportion to the size and importance of the task at hand. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">When your mind is calm and in control, you can attack each task and project in a state of calm focus and productivity—a “flow” state or being “in the zone.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In contrast, when you get overwhelmed and don’t feel in control of your life and to-do list, it’s easy to overreact to small demands and underreact to important ones (for example, flipping out when your boss adds a relatively small task to your plate, or not putting enough energy into an important presentation because you’re too overloaded).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Many people live in a constant state of at least mild stress because they don’t have the tools to manage everything. The GTD program gives you the tools to regain control so that you can access that water state of mind.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Manage Your Commitments</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The source of many people’s stress is having too many internal commitments or not managing them effectively. These commitments can be as big as hiring a new employee or as small as replacing a lightbulb—anything that’s floating around your mind and nagging at you.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the GTD program, these are called “open loops.” </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Open loops pull your attention away from the task at hand and need to be addressed to get them off your mind. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">But you don’t have to actually complete the task in order to get it off your mind.

Many people fall into one of these traps:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">They don’t capture everything, leaving too many open loops in their heads. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">They don’t clarify sufficiently, so they have ambiguous to-do lists, notes, and reminders that don’t tell them exactly <i>what</i> to do. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">They don’t organize efficiently, so the reminders get lost and tasks don’t get done in a timely way. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">They don’t spend enough time reflecting, so they have lists, calendars, and reminders that are overloaded and out-of-date. </span></div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">They tackle whatever is the most immediate and demanding instead of making strategic decisions about what to engage in.</span></b></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Let’s talk about each step, and in later chapters we’ll explore them in more detail.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 1: Capture</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The first critical step is to capture every idea, reminder, and piece of information and get it out of your head. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Capture <i>everything—</i>big and small, short-term and long-term, anything in your life that you feel should be different and that you have some motivation or commitment to change</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">—from career strategy ideas to a reminder to fix that gadget in your junk drawer.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Put all these things into “containers,” which can be:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Paper notebooks, note cards, or pads</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Physical in-trays</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Emails or text messages</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Digital or audio note-taking systems/apps</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Whatever type of container you use, make sure that it is always with you so that you can capture something as soon as the thought enters your head.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">There are three requirements for a successful capture system:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Capture every open loop.</span></b> If you still have things floating around in your head, you won’t have the mental energy to sort through and empty your containers (that’s the next step). </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Have as few capturing buckets as possible.</span></b> If you have too many, the system will get unmanageable and you won’t be able to go through the containers regularly. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Empty your containers regularly. </span></b>If your containers get backlogged, things get lost and your brain won’t trust your system, so it will keep reminding you of things even after you’ve captured them.

Put all these items in the Pending pile. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Decide the next action. </span></b>If it’ll take longer than two minutes and you can’t delegate it, label it “Next Action” and put it in the Pending pile. </div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here’s a flowchart that shows Steps 1 to 3 more clearly.

Based on what you decided in the last step, put each item in one of the following places:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Trash</span></b>: Although you threw away some items during Step 2, you might still come across items that, upon further consideration, you decide you don’t need. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reference files</span></b>: This is where you’ll store information you may want later.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Projects list</span></b>: This is an index of your projects that are in the planning process.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Project Support Materials file</span></b>: This file holds project plans, research, invoices, and other documents.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Waiting For list</span></b>: This is where you’ll keep track of tasks you’re waiting for someone else to complete or items you’ve decided to delegate.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Someday/Maybe list</span></b>: This is the place for things that don’t require any action now, but might later. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Tickler system</span></b>: This system of files functions like your Someday/Maybe list, but creates date-specific reminders to revisit items.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Calendar</span></b>: Schedule actionable items that need to be done at a certain time.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Next Actions list</span></b>: This is your to-do list of items to be tackled as soon as possible.</div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Let’s cover each in more detail.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Reference</span></span></b></h4><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reference materials don’t require any specific action but might be useful to have on hand in the future</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">—whether it’s menus from your favorite food delivery spot or a list of contacts for members of the committee you chair.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reference materials can be stored physically in filing drawers and cabinets or digitally in computer files. If you have emails that you want to keep for reference, you can print them out for your physical filing system or create folders in your email server so they don’t clog up your inbox. For other digital documents, experiment with different methods of organizing (e.g. digital folders, the cloud, or organizing apps and software) to find what works best for you.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">There are two types of reference systems:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Subject-specific, which means you’ll have one folder or one filing cabinet dedicated to one type of document (e.g. past contracts you may need for future reference). </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">General reference, which is the catch-all for anything that doesn’t fall into a specific category. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">It’s critical that you have an easily accessible, well-organized general reference file </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">so that those random notes and documents don’t end up in a pile that overwhelms you—undermining the whole system—or you inadvertently bury actionable items. </span></div></li></ol><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Projects List and Project Support Materials File</span></span></b></h4><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">The GTD program defines projects as anything that takes more than one step and can be completed within a year.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> That includes everything from enrolling your kid in school to planting your garden to learning new software at work.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Since projects require multiple steps to complete, the Projects list helps you keep track of the outcomes or finish lines for each one so that you can:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Regularly determine the appropriate next action </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Know when you’ve completed a project</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You’ll probably accumulate support materials—such as research, invoices, and other documents—for many projects.

Any time you’re waiting on someone, add the item to your Waiting For list so you can keep track of everything and follow up when necessary.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Additionally, if you’re invested in the outcome of an item you’ve delegated to someone else, add that item to your Waiting For list.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Someday/Maybe List and Tickler System</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Some things you’ve captured won’t be actionable <i>yet</i>—maybe a flyer for a concert that’s still a few months away, or an idea for a project you might want to do someday but don’t have time to begin now.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">There are two options for these types of items:</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">1) Someday/Maybe list: This is a running list of things you might want to act on in the future, from learning a new language to making a personal website.

You can also use your calendar for this, for example making a note on March 15 that tax day is one month away.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Calendar</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Among the actionable items that take longer than two minutes and that you can’t delegate, there will be some that are time-sensitive and others that just need to get done as soon as possible.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Use your calendar to track all time-sensitive tasks and information, including:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Actions that are time-specific, such as appointments</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Actions that are day-specific, such as deadlines</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Information that is day-specific, such as directions for an appointment or short-term reminders like “call Suzie when she gets back from vacation”</span></div></li></ul><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">The only items that should go on your calendar are things that must happen on that day or not at all. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">That means no more daily to-do lists; you’ll have a Next Actions list instead, which we’ll talk about next. Daily lists are ineffective for two reasons:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Through the course of the day, you’re likely to get new information and new task assignments that require you to constantly add to and reconfigure your to-do list. Then, not only are you probably ending each day with a discouraging list of things you didn’t get done, but you also have to spend time copying those things over into a new list for the following day. </span></div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">It’s easy to add things that are aspirational rather than absolutely necessary, so your to-do list gets bogged down with extra tasks and you lose sight of what absolutely has to happen today. </span></b>Better to have the calendar strictly show things that must happen that day and supplement with a short list of things you’d like to do if you have time. </div></li></ol><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Next Actions List</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Next Actions list is essentially the catch-all for tasks that are actionable, take longer than two minutes, and can’t be delegated. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reference your Next Actions list whenever you have free time to tackle a task.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you have more than a few dozen next actions on this list, it helps to divide them up into categories based on what you need or where you need to be to tackle them. For example, make a list of the calls you need to make, and another list for tasks that require you to use a computer.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 4: Reflect</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can have all your to-dos organized to a tee, but it does you no good if you don’t regularly review and reflect on them. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Regularly reflecting on all your lists and files helps you make smarter choices about which tasks to tackle</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">; that makes the difference between writing down that you need milk and remembering it when you’re at the grocery store.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Review your calendar most often, because it holds the tasks that have to get done within a certain time window. The Next Actions list will be the second most frequent, so you can see what needs to be done when you have time between scheduled tasks.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Review Everything Weekly</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Given the fast pace of life, even an organized system can collect some debris over the course of a few busy days.</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Instead of taking the time to constantly keep your organization system spotless, try your best to maintain it and set aside time once a week to clean everything up. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Think of it like cleaning your house: You keep things pretty well ordered through the week but it’s not worth your time to deep clean everything every day, so you leave the deep cleaning and laundry for Sundays.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Once a week, review your Projects, Project Plans, Next Actions, Waiting For, and Someday/Maybe lists. During the Weekly Review, you should also:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Capture anything you haven’t captured yet</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clarify any items that you haven’t clarified</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Take stock of your whole organization system to make sure everything is running smoothly </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Update your lists</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clean up and clear things out where needed</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The only way to keep your mind clear is if you trust the system, and in order to trust it, you need to maintain it and keep things current. The Weekly Review is essential for this.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 5: Engage</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The previous four steps—and the entire GTD system—is designed to help you determine how to engage, as in choosing which things to do when. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can only feel confident about what you’re <i>doing</i> if you also feel confident about what you’re <i>not doing</i> at any given moment.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Through capturing, clarifying, organizing, and reflecting, you’ve crystallized the actionable steps you need to get done as soon as possible in your Next Actions list. Use the following three models to choose which item on that list to tackle at any given time.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The Four-Criteria Model: Decide How to Act in the Moment</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you have a few minutes to work on an item on your Next Actions list, use these four criteria to decide which item to tackle by process of elimination:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Context</span></b>: Certain tasks require you to be at a certain location or to have access to a certain tool (for example, at the office or in front of a computer). </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Time available</span></b>: Some tasks require an hour of focused attention, so if you just have a few minutes before your next appointment this isn’t the time for that task. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Energy available</span></b>: Certain tasks require a lot of mental or physical energy, while others don’t need much. Only tackle what you have the energy to take on. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Priority</span></b>: Some tasks naturally have a higher payoff than others, so prioritize those. After narrowing down your options with the first three criteria, use the next two models to prioritize based on your intuition and judgment. </div></li></ol><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The Threefold Model: Evaluate Your Work</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In order to determine what to do, you also need to understand what type of task it is. To further prioritize, categorize your task as one of three different types of activities:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Predefined work </span></b>is essentially anything on your Next Actions list and calendar. You’ve already clarified and deemed that these tasks are important, so make them a high priority.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Work as it shows up </span></b>encompasses all the unanticipated tasks that pop up during your day—your boss walks in your office to talk about a new project, or you find out your aunt is in the hospital and you need to send flowers. Prioritize these tasks when they’re more urgent and important than your predefined work; otherwise, put them in your in-tray.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Defining your work </span></b>is the time you spend maintaining your GTD system, clearing your containers, clarifying tasks, organizing, filing, and doing the actions that take less than two minutes. Prioritize time to do this during your Weekly Review.</div></li></ol><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The Six-Level Model: Put Your Work in Context</span></span></b></h4><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">In order to prioritize the options in front of you, you also need to have a context for how they fit into the bigger picture of your life and priorities.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> If your boss asks you to chair a committee at work, it may seem important until you stop and consider whether devoting your time and energy to that helps you achieve your professional goals.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Consider these six different levels—or horizons—of perspectives to determine your priorities:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ground is the current actions </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">on your Next Actions list. </span></div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 1 is current projects </span></b>with relatively short-term timelines, such as organizing a conference or finding a new dentist. Your projects dictate many of your actions. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 2 is areas of focus and accountabilities</span></b>, or the roles and responsibilities you have, from job duties to maintaining your health and family commitments. This horizon isn’t comprised of tasks but rather the interests and responsibilities that help to determine what projects and actions you’ll take on. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 3 is goals</span></b>, another horizon that dictates your projects, actions, and accountabilities. Specifically, horizon 3 encompasses goals for the next one to two years. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 4 is vision</span></b>, or your goals for the next three to five years. Again, this influences your shorter-term goals as well as your areas of focus, accountabilities, projects, and actions. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 5 is purpose and principles</span></b>; this is the big-picture context of your life. All your actions, projects, focuses, goals, and visions are defined by and also lead you toward your purpose and principles.</div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In Part 2 of this summary, we’ll talk about how to apply these models to your prioritizing and decision-making.</span></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>6</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Exercise: Adapting Your Organization System </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Many people are already doing some aspects of the GTD program without realizing it.

Many of your next actions will stem from projects—which can be anything from getting a new printer to remodeling your home to planning a business merger—so it’s important that you know how to plan and execute them effectively.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">How you approach planning your projects is a critical factor in whether you complete them, how successfully, and how stressful the process is.</span></b></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">The Natural Planning Method Overview</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Many people lean toward formal planning methods, especially in business contexts (for example, planning sessions and project management software).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Planning sessions often start with a manager soliciting ideas for a project such as planning a conference. People start to throw out ideas for venues, events, and speakers, but they don’t make much progress because people are suggesting different cities and topics. The manager then realizes the team needs to organize and brainstorm. But they’re still not getting very far because everyone isn’t on the same page. Finally, they face the question, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">“What’s the vision and purpose?” That’s the foundation of any project. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">This approach is the Reactive Planning Model, and it’s not very efficient or effective.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Taking the wrong approach to planning projects makes the process feel daunting and causes many people to put off planning until the last minute. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Additionally, it can lead you to:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Overlook critical issues</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Not allow enough time for brainstorming</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Neglect nitty-gritty details such as next actions and accountabilities. </span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">By contrast, the Natural Planning Method is a much more effective approach, and you’re probably already doing it in your everyday life—you just might not realize you’re doing it. There are five steps of natural planning; we’ll give an overview of them and look at how they apply to planning a dinner out, then we’ll explain each one in depth.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">1) Define your purpose and principles.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Your purpose is the intention of the project, and your principles create the boundaries.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your purpose in going to dinner is to celebrate a birthday, and the principles or boundaries might include how nice the restaurant will be and its affordability and convenience.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">2) Envision your outcome.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Once you’ve determined that you're planning a project and <i>why</i> you’re planning it (your purpose), you naturally begin to envision <i>what </i>it’ll be like. This is the physical feel, look, and sound of the project.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">For dinner, you might envision your group of friends sharing food and laughs around a big outdoor table.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">3) Brainstorm.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Now that you have the vision, your brain wants to figure out how to make that vision a reality. In random order, your thoughts will bounce around to what you need, who you need to talk to, and how you can accomplish these tasks.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the context of dinner, this includes questions like “Is the restaurant open?” “What time should we go?” and “Is there gas in the car?”</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">4) Organize.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> After the swirl of brainstorming thoughts, you naturally begin to organize them based on components (logistical tasks to make the project happen), priorities (information you need to determine if the project is feasible), and sequences (which actions need to happen first). This is when </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">challenges, comparisons, and evaluations naturally arise because you’re determining which actions are more important and need to happen first. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> In your dinner planning, the components involve inviting people to go, making sure the location will work, and handling logistics. The priorities might be to find out if the birthday girl even wants to go to dinner. The sequences are deciding that first you need to call the restaurant to see if it’s open, then invite the guests, then get yourself dressed and ready to go.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">5) Determine your next actions.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> This is a natural outgrowth of the organizing step.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">For dinner, you’ll have decided that the next action you need to take will be to see if the restaurant is open and make a reservation.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 1: Define Your Purpose and Principles</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">This step is all about defining your <i>why</i>. Why are you doing this project? What’s its purpose? What’s your intention in completing it? What will result from a successful outcome?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Defining your <i>why</i> helps you:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Define what success is.</span></b> If you don’t know your purpose and intention in doing something then you can’t know if you’ve succeeded. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Determine criteria for your decision making. </span></b>Knowing your <span style="font-family: inherit;"><i>why</i></span> allows you to know whether something is necessary for achieving that purpose. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Align resources.</span></b> This is an offshoot of your decision making; an investment is worth it if it helps you achieve your purpose. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Get motivated.</span></b> How can you get excited about doing something if you don’t know why you’re doing it? </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clarify your focus. </span></b>Everything is clearer when your purpose is defined and top-of-mind. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Expand your options. </span></b>When you’re focused and clear on your purpose, then it opens up your creative thinking about all the ways you can achieve it. </div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In order to achieve all these things, your purpose statement must be specific. Broad, ambiguous purpose statements won’t give you an adequate definition of success, nor will it give you clarity or motivation (for example, instead of a purpose being “to assemble a strong team,” a more specific purpose is “to assemble a team of collaborative, motivated people who communicate effectively”).</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">While purpose gives you your <i>why</i>, principles give you your <i>how</i>. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Principles define the parameters for how you and your team achieve your goal. What are the standards and values for behavior?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Principles are always present, though you may not be in the habit of consciously defining them. Pin down your principles by finishing the sentence, “My team can have free rein as long as they …” What are the lines you don’t want crossed? Appeasing the client? Staying under budget? Finishing on time?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Also, ask yourself what kind of conduct could undermine your <i>why</i>. When you have defined your principles, you need to clearly communicate them to everyone involved.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 2: Envision Your Outcome</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your vision is the <i>what</i> of your project—what is it going to look, sound, and feel like? In this step, create the blueprint of your desired result, whether it’s a one-line statement or a fully fleshed out scene in your mind.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Envisioning and focusing on an outcome actually gears your mind toward achieving it; athletes use this method, picturing themselves crossing the finish line first or seeing the basketball drop into the hoop. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you picture something and focus on it, it helps you create it and makes you more excited to tackle it.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">It’s easier to envision an outcome you’ve achieved before or have some experience with, but this step can trip you up when you’re trying to do something you’ve never done before. If you’re struggling with this, focus on specifics.</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">What do you want the finished project to look like?</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">How do you want the client to react? </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">What will change as a result of the success? </span></div></li></ul><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 3: Brainstorm</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Brainstorming is another <i>how</i>, referring not to conduct but to the logistics and steps to accomplishing your project.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you brainstorm, follow these three rules:</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">1) Don’t criticize, judge, or challenge ideas. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can be most creative when you’re not self-censoring or restricting yourself by thinking about what could be wrong with one idea or another. In a group setting, create an open and inclusive atmosphere where people feel comfortable to throw ideas out and see what sticks.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">People can still point out what might be problematic with an idea, but they should frame their thoughts in a way that leads to follow-up ideas, rather than simply shutting down an idea or train of thought.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">2) Aim for quantity over quality.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Cast a wide net for ideas. The more ideas you put out there, the better your odds of having some great ones in the pile.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">3) Analyze and organize later. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Trying to analyze and organize your ideas as you come up with them will stifle your creativity. Let loose now, knowing that you’ll organize your thoughts in the next step of the process.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can brainstorm small projects in your head, but writing down your ideas is useful for the same reason it helps to capture all your tasks in an external place: It gets them out of your head. When you’re brainstorming, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">writing down your ideas frees up your mind to keep thinking creatively and come up with even more ideas. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Since brainstorming produces ideas big and small, in random order, there are several techniques you can use to capture your ideas that are less structured and linear than a list, including:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Mind mapping</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Patterning </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clustering</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Fish boning </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Webbing</span></div></li></ul><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 4: Organize</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Once you’ve emptied your head of all the ideas and questions during the brainstorming process, you’ll begin to see a natural order and structure to them.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you organize, follow these three steps:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Determine the most important aspects that must happen in order for the project to be completed and successful.</span></b></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Sort them into components, priorities, and sequences. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Fill in the necessary detail. </span></div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Depending on the project and your preference, you can achieve this with quick bullet points, outlines, or project-planning software.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Step 5: Next Actions</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">This is the stage when you determine what can actually be done now, and who’s going to do it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you have a project with multiple components, take a look at whether there are next actions for each of them; sometimes, you won’t be able to start work on one component until you’ve made progress on another component.</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Across the scope of the project, identify every next action that you (or someone on your team) can start moving on now. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you’re working on a team, you don’t need to know every person’s next action. Just make sure each person has her assignment, and she can determine her next actions. If you’re waiting on someone else to finish something before you can take your next action, keep track of it on a project-specific Waiting For list (we’ll talk more about Waiting For lists in Chapter 7).</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">This stage brings issues and questions to the surface, because you have to break things down to each minute action. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you discover holes in the planning and details, your next action might be some aspect of planning—brainstorming ideas, getting feedback from others, or planning meetings.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you need more clarity on the project in order to determine next actions, move up the natural planning process to get things better organized, brainstorm more ideas, or get a better grasp of your vision or purpose. On the other hand, if you see that there’s not enough movement on the project, move down; flesh out and organize ideas so that you can determine next actions and actually start <i>doing </i>them.</span></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>8</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Exercise: Apply The Natural Planning Method </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Practice applying the Natural Planning Method to a project in your life.</span></div><hr><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Step 1—Define Your Purpose and Principles: Think of a project you’re currently working on or plan to begin soon.

If you don’t have a place for documents that aren’t actionable but that contain information you might need later, they’ll clutter up your workspace and your mind, making it hard to keep up with the system.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you prefer, you can also digitize just about everything in your files (except the currency) to make it accessible from anywhere. But allow some time to figure out the scanning, organizing, and digital storage workflow that works best for you.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here are some tips to make your filing system a success:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keep your general-reference files within arm’s reach.</span></b> An easy and accessible system encourages you to keep up with it and file documents away before they pile up in your in-tray. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keep extra file folders on hand. </span></b>Eliminate any roadblocks to filing, so if you have something that doesn’t fit in an existing file, make a file on the spot and keep things moving. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Use your labeler to label files.</span></b> The uniformity is aesthetically pleasing and makes the filing system easier to use. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Alphabetize your files. </span></b>Instead of organizing files by subject or project, keep them in alphabetical order for simplicity and to minimize the chance that you won’t remember where something is when you’re looking for it. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Don’t overstuff your filing cabinet. </span></b>Try to keep your file drawer from getting more than three-quarters full. You’ll be less inclined to file if it’s overflowing. If you have to buy another filing cabinet, first see if you have any files you can purge and then accept that if things are worth keeping, they’re worth keeping organized. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Comb through files and purge once a year.</span></b> Regularly purging your files has two benefits: First, it keeps things clean, current, and organized. Second, you can feel comfortable keeping and filing documents that you’re not sure you’ll need, because you’ll have the chance to reassess during your annual purge. (It may be helpful to put a reminder for your yearly purge day on your calendar or in your tickler file.)</div></li></ul><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>10</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Exercise: Establish Your GTD Setup </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Implementing the GTD system requires some time, space, and the right tools.</span></div><hr><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Looking at your schedule, when can you dedicate a day or two to setting up your GTD system, ideally without any distractions?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Where in your home can you dedicate a workspace (that you don’t have to share) to keep your in-trays, files, and tools?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Which tools do you need to buy to set up your workspace?</span></div><div><br></div><div style="margin-bottom:24px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you plan to use digital storage, what system or software do you plan to use?</span></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>11</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Chapter 5: Step 1—Capture Everything </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now that you have your workspace set up and the time set aside, dive in with the first step: capturing.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">There are a few benefits to getting everything in one place in front of you before you begin the next step, clarifying:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You know how much stuff you have to go through. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You have a definitive endpoint (at least for now, until life gives you more to capture). </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can focus on clarifying and organizing when you get to those steps, without feeling like there’s still more stuff out there. </span></div></li></ol><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Part 1: Capture Physical Items</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Capturing is more all-encompassing than simply jotting down a list off the top of your head. For your initial capturing, go through physical holders of notes and reminders, including:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Bulletin boards </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Cabinets </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Countertops </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Desktop</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Desk drawers</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Floors </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Office (or second office space)</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Shelves</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you can’t get to every spot right now, make a placeholder note (e.g. “Clean out hall closet”) and put it in your in-tray to remind you to do it later.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Gather anything that doesn’t belong where it is the way it is, and put it all into your in-tray. This includes:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Binders </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Business cards</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Catalogs </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Mail</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Manuals</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Notes</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reading material </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Receipts </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reference materials </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reports</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">By the nature of this process, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">you’ll end up with a lot of things that aren’t that important</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">—that’s why you probably put them off in the first place. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">But you need to capture them nonetheless</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> so that you have no open loops.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Follow these guidelines for capturing:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Scan your entire physical surroundings for anything that is incomplete (for example, gadgets that need to be repaired and furniture you’ve been meaning to move). </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Generally, you can leave supplies (such as stationery, batteries, and paper clips), reference material (such as software manuals and contact lists), decorations (such as photos and artwork), and equipment (such as a computer and printer) where they are <i>unless </i>there’s something about them you need to move, fix, update, or otherwise alter. </span></div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">This isn’t about throwing everything away. This system is designed to allow you to keep everything you want to keep</span></b>, as long as it’s either the way you want and in the place you want it or it has been captured.</div></li></ul><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Beware of Capturing Pitfalls</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Capturing is a big job, and it’s easy to get tripped up along the way. There are several common capturing issues that you can avoid.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">First, if an item is too big to physically fit in your in-tray, simply write a note on a piece of paper to represent it (it’s good practice to date it, too) and put that in your in-tray. If your pile of papers is too big to fit in your in-tray, make stacks around the in-tray and just be careful that it’s clear that they’re “in” and they don’t get mixed up with other documents.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Second, when you come across things that you immediately know you won’t need, trash it on the spot. However, if you have any doubt, just put it in your in-tray and rest assured that you’ll have time to assess it during the clarifying stage; clarifying requires a different mindset, and you don’t want to let yourself get caught up in that right now. For now, just </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">focus on capturing everything as quickly as possible.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Similarly, don’t fall into a rabbit hole of purging and organizing as you go through your house, office, and other physical spaces. If you have the time to do it, then go for it, but capturing is your priority. To keep things moving, add papers to your in-tray that remind you to “purge kitchen cabinet” or “organize desk” later.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Third, if you already have certain items on lists or in organizers, simply treat them as items to be processed. You want everything in a single, uniform system, so unless your current organization fits the GTD model, you need to reorganize it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Fourth, if you come across something that you forgot about but is fairly urgent, you can:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Do it now. It’s best to avoid interrupting the capturing process, but if it’s absolutely urgent, you’re better off getting it done and off your mind. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Put it in the in-tray. Don’t worry about losing it in the ever-growing stack in your in-tray because you’ll be sorting through that pile next so you’ll come across this reminder within the next couple of hours or days. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Put it in an emergency stack. Ideally, you want everything in a single in-tray pile, but if this solution puts your mind at ease you’ll be better able to finish capturing. </span></div></li></ol><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Part 2: Capture Mental Items</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">After sweeping through your office, home, and anywhere else you’ve stored tasks and reminders, wrack your brain for anything else that’s still pulling at your attention. Just like with the physical capturing process, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">capture everything—big and small, urgent and aspirational—that’s taking up any space in your brain. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Write each thought, idea, project, and reminder on a separate sheet of paper. This might seem inefficient, and you’ll probably end up with a lot of papers, but this makes the clarifying stage much easier.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Random thoughts may remind you of certain tasks, so review these lists of “Incompletion Triggers” to see if it reminds you of something you need to capture.

If you’re implementing the GTD system as you read this, you may want to read this chapter and the next before moving forward on clarifying your “in” items.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here’s the big picture of how this works: First, in Step 2, decide what action each item needs</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">—</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">for some items, the action will be the next thing you need to do to accomplish the task (for example, call your mechanic), and for others, it’ll be to delegate the task or file the item for later. If there’s anything you can throw away or complete in less than two minutes, do it now. Otherwise, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">label each item according to what you decide. Then, in Step 3, you’ll physically sort everything into their appropriate files and lists.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Back to Step 2: Emptying your in-tray might seem like a daunting task, so follow these guidelines to get through it.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Rule #1: One at a Time, Starting at the Top</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In order to get through this pile, you need to treat each item equally: Pick one up, decide what to do with it, and mark it accordingly (e.g. calendar, Next Actions list, Projects list).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You may be tempted to do an “emergency scan” of your tasks, quickly perusing for the most urgent, enjoyable, easy, or interesting item to tackle first. But that makes it easy to neglect certain items and put off making a decision about them.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">The most effective way to empty your in-tray is to work through each item from the list top-down </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">(or, if you prefer, flip the in-tray upside down and work from the top-down so you start with the first items you put in the tray).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Additionally, assessing just one item at a time forces you to dedicate enough attention to decide what to do with each one.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The only exception to this is if you’re the rare person who’s more effective and efficient when you multitask. Some people can only make a decision about an item if they briefly shift their attention to something else and then come back to it. If this is you, take two or three items out at a time, but be sure to make a decision about each one within a minute or two of pulling it out.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Rule #2: Never Put Anything Back Into the In-Tray</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Another key to getting through your in-tray is to force yourself to process each item when you pull it out. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Don’t put anything back in the in-tray or to the side undecided, or else you’ll finish emptying your in-tray and still have another pile to go through.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Research proves that “decision fatigue” is real—people lose a little bit of their limited brain power and energy with every decision they make. Paradoxically, making the decision to leave an item undecided wears away at your mental energy without achieving anything productive.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Non-Actionable Items</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Items that don’t require any immediate action can go into the:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Trash</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reference pile </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Pending pile </span></div></li></ol><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Trash: </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You probably threw away a lot of stuff while capturing, but you’re bound to come across more trash as you process your in-tray. In fact, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">as you clarify everything you’ll probably create stricter boundaries to what kinds of tasks you take on in the future. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Overall, whether you err on the side of throwing things out or keeping them depends on what will put your mind more at ease—and how much space you have to store things. Digital storage offers the freedom to keep as much as you want and navigate it with the search function, but don’t take this as permission to keep things indiscriminately.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reference pile: </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Label items that are purely informational (like a note from HR outlining a new company policy) as “reference” and set them aside in their own pile. You’ll put them into reference files in the next step.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Pending Pile:</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Label items that you don’t need to act on now but might want to follow-up on later with “incubation.” Put these in a Pending pile; in the next step, you’ll sort these into a Someday/Maybe list or create reminders in a tickler file or on your calendar.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Determining Next Actions</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">A key piece of Getting Things Done is to </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">figure out what the next action for every actionable item is</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">. This has a psychological benefit—it reduces a daunting task into a smaller action that seems much easier to do.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">It may sound fairly simple to decide on next actions for most items, but it can be deceptively challenging to boil it down to the immediate next specific action.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">For example, if an item says “clean the garage,” at first it seems that cleaning the garage <i>is</i> the next action. But then you remember the old refrigerator in the garage that you want to offer to a friend. So your next action is actually “call John to ask if he wants the refrigerator.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Similarly, an item as simple as “schedule meeting” doesn’t actually specify whom you’re inviting to the meeting, whether you’re inviting them via phone or email, and if you need to book a conference room for the meeting. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clarifying the next physical action for each item gets all the thinking out of the way </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">so that when you have time to pick up your Next Actions list and do a task, all you have to do is sit down and do it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keep in mind that merely making a decision can’t be a next action—there’s typically a physical activity that will assist your decision-making, such as consulting someone else or brainstorming ideas. That activity would be your next action.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Once you have the next action figured out, in the GTD system you can:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Put in on your Projects list</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Do it </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Delegate it</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Defer it </span></div></li></ol><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Option 1: Put It on Your Projects List</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">As we talked about, the GTD program defines projects as anything that takes more than one action to complete and that can be finished within a year. Since your next actions need to be specific steps, this broad definition creates a place—your Project list—to track all ongoing tasks.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Tracking your projects helps you:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keep progress moving forward </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keep the projects off your mind </span></div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Make a note on each item that belongs on your Projects list, and put them in a Pending pile. You’ll sort this pile into the appropriate lists and folders in the next step.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Option 2: Do It</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If the next action takes less than two minutes, do it now. Even if it’s not a high priority, two minutes is roughly the efficiency cutoff: </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">It’s more efficient to get a two-minute task out of the way now than to spend the time storing and tracking the item to do later. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">This rule is especially effective for getting through a backlog of emails, most which typically take less than two minutes to read and fire back a quick response.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you have a little more time, make the cutoff five or 10 minutes instead of two. Conversely, if you’re tight on time, restrict the two-minute rule to just one-minute or thirty-second tasks.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If the two-minute action doesn’t complete the project—just one step of it—then be sure to clarify the next action and (in the next step) organize that appropriately.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Don’t use your whole day completing two-minute tasks, whether they’re tasks that show up unexpectedly (for example, a coworker comes by your desk and asks you to do something) or you’re emptying your in-tray. (Shortform note: The book doesn’t say how to prevent this from happening, only that you must capture, process, and organize anything you don’t do on the spot.)</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Option 3: Delegate It</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you decide to delegate something, it’s not off your plate entirely.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your next action to delegate is most likely to reach out to the person you’re delegating it to. You can do this in several ways—some may be more appropriate depending on the context (for example, a sensitive subject may require a face-to-face conversation), but generally, this is the order of the most efficient approaches:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Send her an email. </span></b>This creates a digital record of the correspondence and allows the other person to respond at her convenience.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Write her a note. </span></b>This also creates a written record and allows the other person to respond at her convenience. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Send her a text or leave her a voicemail.</span></b> This option also gives the person time to respond, but voicemails leave no record (unless you leave them in your inbox, creating another item to capture and organize) and text messages are so concise that they’re often misunderstood.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Bring it up next time you see her.</span></b> This delays progress until you get a chance to meet with the person, but this might be the necessary approach for sensitive subjects. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Approach her to discuss it. </span></b>This option keeps things moving but risks interrupting both your and her workflow. This also leaves no written record.</div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Make a note of your next action (who you’ll contact and how) on each item you’re delegating and put it in the Pending pile. This action will be added to your Next Actions list in the next step. If you have a stake in the task you’ve delegated, also label it “Waiting For”—you’ll add it to your Waiting For list in the next step.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Option 4: Defer It</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Any other actions that you have to do but can’t complete in less than two minutes will go in the Pending pile. Each item in this pile should have a Post-it note with the next action written on it.</span></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>14</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Chapter 7: Step 3—Organizing </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Once you’ve clarified what you need to do with each item, it’s time to physically sort them in your organizing system. You should now have an empty in-tray and two piles: a pile of </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">reference items</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> and a </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Pending pile.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You’ll organize the Pending pile by placing items in the following places (discussed in more detail below):</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Projects list</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Project support material folder </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Waiting For list</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Someday/Maybe list</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Tickler file</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Calendar actions/information</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Next Actions list</span></div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your lists can be numbered lists (on paper or in digital form) or can be folders of papers labeled with separate items.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">As you organize, keep in mind that although you threw away some items during Step 2, you might still come across items that, upon further consideration, you decide you don’t need. Trash them.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You won’t—and probably shouldn’t—crystallize your organization system when you first get the Getting Things Done program up and running. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your organization system needs to reflect what works best for you, and that will take time and some trial and error to figure out.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now let’s take a closer look at each category.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Reference Materials</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Start with your reference pile. Your general-reference file holds information that is critically important and vastly diverse. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">In order for your general-reference information to be useful, your organization must be simple and easily navigable.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Follow these guidelines to effectively organize general-reference materials:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Base it on how accessible you need certain information to be. Make information you need frequently easily accessible, perhaps on your cell phone, while documents you only need at work can be filed in your office. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Do what works for you. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Try different systems </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">(paper-based or digital) </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">and customize them to your needs. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You won’t know what works until you start using a system. </span></div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">There are multiple locations where you can keep your general-reference material, based on the content.</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">General-reference filing holds a broad range of material, so keep this culled, organized, and current so you can find what you need when you need it.</span></b> You can have a paper-based file folder (or filing drawer or cabinet, for big projects) or a digital storage system. The nature of many projects will require you to have both paper-based and digital filing because you’ll get materials in both forms.&nbsp; </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Large-category filing </span></b>may be necessary for large projects that encompass dozens of folders or huge documents. You can use an entire filing drawer, filing cabinet, or digital database to hold this material. Alphabetize this material or organize it in some other easily searchable way because of the large volume. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Contact managers </span></b>store people’s contact information as well as other notes like birthdays, hobbies, anniversaries, and names of family members. In a professional context, you might also have a hiring date, goals, and performance-review dates associated with each person. Depending on your preference, you can keep this information in a paper-based file or contact book or in a digital contact manager. Keep any reminders and actions associated with the person out of the contact manager and on your Next Actions or other appropriate lists. </div></li></ul><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Projects List</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Next, go through your Pending pile and find the items labeled “Projects list.” </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your Projects list is purely an index of your projects—it shouldn’t include the plans or details for any of your projects.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Those kinds of details will be on your calendar, Next Actions list, and files of project support materials.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keeping your Projects list complete, current, and straightforward has several benefits:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can easily scan and review it (during your Weekly Review) to make sure that you’ve defined next actions and haven’t forgotten about any projects in progress.</span></div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You get a quick snapshot of your total workload, in case you need to reassess any of your commitments</span></b>.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can feel focused and in control, knowing that you’re tracking everything in progress and nothing is slipping through the cracks. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You’re less likely to underestimate and neglect seemingly simpler projects, such as enrolling your child in preschool. </span></div></li></ol><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">How to Identify Hidden Projects</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Despite the exhaustive capturing process, there may still be projects that you haven’t recognized or added to your Projects list. You may find unrecognized projects in these three places:</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">1) </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Current activities</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">: Look through your workspace, calendar, and next actions to find pieces of projects. For example, maybe you have a meeting on your calendar about an upcoming presentation, but the presentation itself isn’t on your Projects list. Or maybe you have a note to call Susan about a fundraiser on your Calls to Make list (covered in the Next Actions section),&nbsp; but planning the fundraiser isn’t on your Projects list.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">2) </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Higher-horizon goals and interests</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">: Take stock of your longer-term goals and interests and you’ll find projects such as learning a professional skill or planning for retirement.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">3) </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Problems and opportunities</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">: </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Problems, improvements, and opportunities all present the opportunity to create projects </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">that resolve the issues or capitalize on the opportunities. First, reaching a solution to any problem is most likely a multi-step project. This can include addressing an issue with your landlord to resolving a dispute with your business partner.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Second, you may notice inefficiencies or frustrations in your workflow—whether for storage, record keeping, keeping in touch with people, or filing—that could or needs to be improved. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can create projects that reconfigure your workflow and ultimately improve your life.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Third, put things that you’ve thought about doing or want to try on your Projects list, such as learning photography or Italian cooking. You can initially put these on your Someday/Maybe list, but as you use the GTD system more and get a better grasp on your life, shift some of those someday projects into current projects.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Organizing Your Projects</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Projects list can be a numbered or bulleted list on a sheet of paper or digital organizer or it can be a file folder with separate sheets of paper for each project.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">A master Projects list is sufficient for most people, but you may find it makes more sense for you to have a list for each category of project. Consider these categories:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Delegated Projects</span></b>: If you’re in a management position, you probably have several projects that you’ve delegated to your staff, so keep track of them on a single list. This is like making a specific category of a Waiting For list.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Personal or Professional Projects</span></b>: Home projects and work projects require a different mindset and often different sets of skills and windows of time; separating them lets you quickly scan only your professional projects in a glance. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Types of Projects</span></b>: If you tend to have a lot of the same types of projects, consider grouping them. For example, if you’re a public speaker you can have a “Projects—Presentations” list. Consider separate lists for projects relating to your children, hobby, or different aspects of a business management (such as operations, finance, and sales) </div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Some projects are so big they encompass sub-projects; for example, a project to renovate your house includes sub-projects such as upgrading the kitchen and setting up a home office. In these cases, you can:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Make each sub-project a separate item on the Projects list.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Make the main project an item on the Projects list and keep a list of the sub-projects in your Project Support Material folder.</span></div></li></ol><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Project Support Materials File</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now, gather all your project support materials from the Pending pile. Your project support materials are purely reference material that is specific to a particular project.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Don’t include reminders or action items—those need to be on your Next Actions list, calendar, or Waiting For list. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">When reminders are hidden away in your Project Support Materials file, it’s easy to lose track of your next actions and delay progress</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">; or, if you do remember that you need to work on the project, this isn’t an efficient way to clarify what needs to be done and doesn’t encourage you to make any progress.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Consider using a Pending tray or a standing file holder on your desk to keep your project support materials more accessible than your general-reference files.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Organizing Project Ideas</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">As you’re working on a project, you’ll probably have notes and ideas that you don’t want to act on yet but want to keep around for consideration and reference. There are several ways you can organize these notes along with your project support materials.</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Attach a note to the project in your Projects list</span></b>—either with a digital note in organizing software, a Post-it note next to the item on your paper-based list, or on the sheet of paper representing the project in your Projects folder. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Type up your notes or ideas in an email </span></b>and add to it dedicated email folders containing project support materials. If a project has a huge volume of emails, consider creating multiple folders, such as “active” and “archive” folders. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keep a notebook with your Projects list, support materials, and blank pages left open for thoughts and ideas</span></b>. This makes it easy to sketch out ideas in different forms, including images and mind maps. </div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">However you organize your “back-of-the-envelope” thoughts, they must be easily accessible so you can review them regularly to determine a next action.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Waiting For List</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Check your Pending pile for items labeled “Waiting for.” Add them to your Waiting For list.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Use your Waiting For list to keep track of two types of items:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Tasks you’ve delegated and want to monitor. These items typically don’t require any next action. They merely serve as reminders so you can check on their progress and outcome. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Steps in a project that someone else needs to complete before you can take your next action (for example, if you called a vendor for a price quote).</span></div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Each entry on the list should have the task, who’s responsible, the date you made the request, and the due date. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Regularly review your Waiting For list so you can determine if you need to check on the status of something or nudge a project forward. </span></b></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Someday/Maybe List</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">At this point, your Pending pile should be much smaller. Turn your attention to items labeled “incubation.” These items will likely go to one of three places: your Someday/Maybe list, your tickler file, or your calendar.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">A Someday/Maybe list gives you the freedom to explore your goals, fantasies, and aspirations without having to commit to doing anything now</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">—from learning a new language to tackling a certain home improvement project</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Furthermore, listing these ideas increases the likelihood that you’ll achieve them.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can keep a master Someday/Maybe list or divide them up into subcategories, which can help distinguish between items that you want to do as soon as you have the time and money (such as home improvements) as opposed to bucket list-type items (like learning French).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Consider these categories:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Activities to do with your kids/family</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Books to read</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Food (for example, recipes and restaurants to try)</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Gift ideas</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Hobbies to explore</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Movies to watch</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Skills to learn</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Things to buy or make for your home</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Trips to take</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Websites to check out</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Periodically review your Projects list for any projects that aren’t urgent and could move over from your current commitments to your Someday/Maybe list. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you realistically won’t be able to make progress on a project for at least a few months, switch it to your Someday/Maybe list to declutter your Projects list. </span></b></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Don’t Confuse “Someday/Maybe” With “Hold and Review”</span></span></b></h4><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Don’t use your Someday/Maybe file as a Hold-and-Review file, with things you may be interested in that you’ve set aside to process later. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Doing this clogs your Someday/Maybe list with things that really need to be captured in your in-tray and clarified; some of your Hold-and-Review items will belong in your Someday/Maybe file, but others will probably end up in the trash, in your general-reference file, on your calendar, in a tickler file, and even on your Next Actions list.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Tickler File</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The second destination for “incubation” items is the tickler file. If you want a reminder to revisit an item later, put it here. For example, if you have a flyer for a concert you want to attend, put the flyer in your tickler file for the date the tickets go on sale.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">A tickler file consists of 43 file folders: Twelve labeled with the months of the year and the rest labeled “1” through “31” for each day of the month. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">File agendas, flyers, and other documents into the file for the day you want to be reminded. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">On the first day of each month, open that month’s file and put all the contents into your in-tray, then move that file to the back. Each day, do the same with that day’s folder contents and move the empty file behind the folder for the upcoming month so that tomorrow’s folder is always in front.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The tickler file is a good place for:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Travel documents you need on the day of a trip</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">An agenda for the day of a meeting</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">A report you want to read and review on a later date</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">A flyer for an event you might be interested in attending</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">A form that needs to be filled out for an appointment that day</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you’ll be away from your tickler file for a weekend or a trip, pull all the contents for the days you’ll be gone <i>before </i>you leave.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Calendar</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Other “incubation” items may belong on your calendar. As we talked about, put only time- and date-specific items on your calendar; don’t dilute it with aspirational items that belong on your Next Actions list.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">However, in addition to items like meetings and appointments, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">you can also use your calendar for date-specific reminders</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> (this works just like the tickler file, but the tickler file is better for reminders that have necessary documents).Use your calendar for:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Reminders for launching projects</span></b>: If it’s too early to start a project now, pick a day to start planning and flag it in your calendar. When that day comes, add that item to your Projects list. You can do this for product launches, annual conferences, or occasions like birthdays and anniversaries when you want to plan a date or buy a gift. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Events you’re considering attending</span></b>: If you find out about an event but you don’t want to commit until you have a better sense of your schedule, pick a date on your calendar that gives you enough lead time and put a reminder to decide then. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Decisions you’re not ready to make now</span></b>: If you’re not ready to make a decision, put a reminder on your calendar to reassess on another date. This category probably includes some major life decisions like career changes and hiring or firing. </div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Delaying decisions may seem counter to the GTD philosophy (don’t leave things floating around undecided), but it’s acceptable as long as you have a system to store that item and revisit it later. Delaying a decision is fine if:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You need more information from yourself (for example, you want to sleep on it). If instead you need more information from an external source, determine a next action and then put the item on your Waiting For list. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You want to wait until it gets closer so you can decide how to act (for example, waiting to see the weather forecast before buying tickets to a baseball game). </span></div></li></ol><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Next Actions</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The only items left in your Pending pile should be those labeled “Next Actions.” Most people end up with 50 or more items on their Next Actions lists. When you have a few minutes to knock out a couple of tasks, scanning through a list this long is unproductive and makes you lose valuable time. Instead,</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> divide your next actions into separate lists based on location or context. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Categorizing your next actions makes the most of your time when you’re in a certain location (for example, at the office) or have a certain tool on hand (such as a computer). It also helps when you’re in a certain work mode: When you’re humming along at your computer, it’s more efficient to tackle computer tasks than to shift gears and make calls.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Consider these categories:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Agendas: </span></b>This category is for the things you need to bring up when you speak to certain people. Create separate lists for your boss, assistant, spouse, children, financial adviser, accountant, and attorney. This is also useful to help you remember everything you want to bring up at regular weekly/monthly/quarterly meetings. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Calls to Make:</span></b> Check this list anytime you have a few minutes and have a phone on hand. To maximize your efficiency, include necessary phone numbers when you add items to the list. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Computer Tasks: </span></b>Also consider creating a separate list for items that require an internet connection. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Errands:</span></b> Make the most of every trip by checking your Errands list to see if you can accomplish another task along the way.Consider creating sublists, so that if you have a “hardware store” item, you can create a sublist of everything you need to buy while you’re there. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Home: </span></b>This is likely to include household chores, reminders, and repairs. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Office:</span></b> This is useful if you need to talk to someone at the office or use a piece of equipment that’s only available there. If you have more than one office location, consider creating separate lists for each. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Read/Review: </span></b>This file can include reports, articles, and other reading materials and is useful when you’re waiting for an appointment or a meeting to start or have another odd window of time. This file can get big, so follow the Two-Minute Rule for any short reading material. </div></li></ul><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Reminders: Written Notes vs. Original Item</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">There are two types of reminders you’ll capture in your in-tray and sort into the appropriate folders:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Notes you write on a piece of paper</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Documents and other original materials</span></div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">It usually makes more sense to write a note with a reminder to call the plumber than to print and file the email from your spouse telling you to call the plumber.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">However,</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> sometimes it’s more efficient to use the original item as your reminder.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> For example, instead of writing a reminder to read a magazine, simply put the magazine in your Read/Review file.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Additionally, if your work calls for you to process a lot of one type of document (such as service requests), just file the actual service requests in the appropriate folders. Don’t put them all in a Service Request file, but rather sort them based on the action required for each: One might belong in the Calls to Make file while another should go in the Waiting For folder.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you spend a lot of time on email, consider using the emails themselves as reminders and sorting them into folders within the email system. Create an Action folder and a Waiting For folder for your emails, and work through your inbox just like you would your in-tray, eventually emptying it entirely. Be sure to review these folders as regularly as you review your other Next Actions and Waiting For lists.</span></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>15</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Exercise: Get Organized </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You’ve done the hard work of capturing and clarifying everything.

In order for the Getting Things Done system to work, you need to regularly reflect, review, and update everything. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your lists and files do you no good if you don’t consistently look at or update them.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Review your calendar and daily tickler file most often. They give you the “hard landscape” of your day, so you know how much time you have—or don’t—for other tasks.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your Next Actions list is your second most frequently reviewed resource. Check it to remind yourself what tasks you have on deck so that you can weigh them against work that comes in throughout the day. Even if you don’t do anything on your Next Actions list on a given day, you need to know what’s there to feel confident about your choice to put it off.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Additionally, have any list you need on hand at the moment you need it: If you have a few free minutes with your phone, be sure you can access and check your Calls list, or if you’re going into a meeting with your boss, have your Agenda on hand so you can review other items you want to bring up with her.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The only way to keep nagging thoughts and reminders off your brain is to keep your system reliable, effective, and current. Make sure the system stays that way during your Weekly Review.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">A Weekly Review Is Critical to Success</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">No matter how organized and efficient your system is, sometimes things come at you too fast to capture, clarify, and file everything on the spot. That’s why the Weekly Review is so critical to keep current on everything.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Besides simply catching up, your Weekly Review gives you a moment to reflect and come up with new ideas to capture.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Additionally, the Weekly Review keeps you aware of the tasks and projects on your plate so that you can better navigate incoming work through the course of the week.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">During your Weekly Review, you’ll:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Capture and clarify</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Update</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Innovate</span></div></li></ol><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Step 1: Capture and Clarify</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your Weekly Review is the time to go through a smaller version of the massive capturing and clarifying process you undertook to implement the GTD system.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Go through all your pockets, your purse, your briefcase, your desk drawers, your countertops, and your car. Gather every loose item—from meeting notes to business cards to flyers from your kid’s school—and put them in your in-tray.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">work through that in-tray, as well as your email inbox, text messages, and voicemails. Review everything that’s collected there since the last time you went through it. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Finally, capture everything else that’s floating around your head. Use the list of triggers in part 2 of Chapter 5 to jog your memory.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Step 2: Update</span></span></b></h4><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your system won’t work if it gets clogged up with old items and isn’t up-to-date with all your current ones. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Customize your Weekly Review to fit your preferences and organizational style, but at least do the following:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Review your Next Actions list</span></b> to check off any items you’ve completed. Check your reminders and identify next actions you need to add to your list.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Look at all the entries from the past two weeks on your calendar.</span></b> For every meeting or appointment, consider whether there’s a related next action or reminder that you haven’t captured (for example, at your sales meeting last week you said you’d look into new potential clients). </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Do the same with your upcoming calendar entries. </span></b>Make sure all projects are on your Projects list, you’re aware of any preparation you need for upcoming events, and necessary next actions are on your list. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Review your Waiting For list</span></b> to determine whether you need to follow up, take any action to spur progress, or add your questions or comments to your Agenda list for the next time you talk to the person responsible. Mark off anything that’s been completed. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Review your Projects list </span></b>to ensure that the status of every project is up-to-date and that at least one next action is clarified and recorded for each project. Look through your project support materials to refresh yourself on plans and details and to see if anything needs to be added to your Next Actions or Waiting For lists. </div></li></ol><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Step 3: Innovate</span></span></b></h4><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">When your system is running and you’ve got a grasp on everyday demands, you’ll end up with time to come up with new ideas, goals, and visions.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Think big. You’ve just reviewed all the current demands on your time and have the clarity to consider your other horizons: What are your long-term goals? Are you working toward the lifestyle you want? Are you making the career progress you envisioned? Does the way you spend your time align with your values and priorities? Add goals and ideas to your system.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">These ideas will occur to you spontaneously as you clear your head of the clutter of to-dos, but you can also review your Someday/Maybe list. If you’ve cleared enough time, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">consider taking on a Someday/Maybe and adding items to your current Projects list</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">. Delete any Someday/Maybes that you’re no longer interested in, and add any new ones that you’re considering.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Schedule Your Weekly Review</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you perform your Weekly Review is up to you—just make sure to devote adequate time (about two hours for most people) when you’ll be focused and uninterrupted. Make it fit your life so you’ll keep your commitment to doing it every week.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Some people like doing their Weekly Review on Sundays at their home office, so they can prepare for the upcoming week. Others prefer to do it Friday afternoons at the office because:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Everything from the week is still fresh in your mind.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you need to contact anyone about an item, she’s still at work and available. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You get to clear your head so you can relax over the weekend. </span></div></li></ul><hr><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now that you know what’s in front of you, in the next chapter we’ll look at the final step of the GTD program: actually <i>doing</i> your tasks and projects.</span></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>17</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Exercise: Review Your To-Dos </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You have to regularly review your calendar and lists in order for them to be of any use.</span></div><hr><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In your current organization system, how often do you look at your calendar, organizer, and/or to-do list?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">At any given time, do you feel you have a grasp of all the projects you’re committed to and the tasks on your to-do list?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">How often do you review your schedule and update your calendar and to-do list?</span></div><div><br></div><div style="margin-bottom:24px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">When and where would be the best setting for you to do a Weekly Review?</span></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>18</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Chapter 9: Engage </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">It’s the moment of truth: You have a half-hour free in your schedule. What do you do?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The simple answer is to trust your intuition. But with so many tasks pulling at you from different areas of your life, that’s easier said than done.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Let’s dive deeper into the three frameworks for prioritizing that we talked about in Chapter 2.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">The Four Criteria Model for Narrowing Down Your Options</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Begin by narrowing down your options using the following four criteria.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Criteria #1: Context</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Consider the context. If you’ve divided your next actions into categories—such as Calls to Make and Computer Tasks—then you can easily pull up the list that applies to where you are and what tools you have available. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Categorized lists save you the time and brain power it takes to scan through a master Next Actions list and determine which tasks you can tackle in a given context. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You can be creative with the categories of your action lists, such as creating a “Brain Gone” list for mindless tasks and a “Less Than 5-Minute” list for quick tasks. You can also make time-sensitive lists and group everything you need to accomplish before a certain deadline—for example, before you leave for a trip—into one list.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You might not need to get this specific when you’re starting out with the Getting Things Done system, but as time goes on create new lists based on what works for you.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Criteria #2: Time</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">How much time do you have? If you have only 15 minutes before your next appointment, don’t dive into something that’s going to take an hour to accomplish.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Narrowing your options to fit the time you have maximizes your productivity by making use of odd windows of time in your day</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">, for instance while you’re on hold on the phone, waiting for a meeting to start, or sitting in the waiting room at your doctor’s office.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Criteria #3: Energy</span></span></b></h4><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You have only so much physical energy and brainpower, so be realistic about your energy level and choose an action that matches.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> If you’re working on something mentally demanding, you’ll eventually reach a point of diminishing returns; although you might be able to push through, you’re not going to get the most productivity for your time and effort.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Instead, switch to a task that requires less effort, like calling your sister about her visit or changing your flight reservation (pull out your “Brain Gone” list). This is a great way to continue being productive while still giving your brain a rest—you’ll feel more accomplished (and perhaps energized) than if you’d stepped away from everything.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Criteria #4: Priority</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Once you’ve narrowed down your options, the big question is: What’s the biggest priority? There’s no objective answer to this question because it factors in your various roles, responsibilities, goals, and values.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In order to prioritize, consider what category of work a task falls into, which we’ll explore in the next model, as well as your six horizons, which we’ll talk about in the following model.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">The Threefold Model for Evaluating Your Work</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Think of everything you have to do in both the personal and professional areas of your life as “work.” Given that context, you face three different types of work on any given day:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Predefined work</span></b>: This is the actions you’ve already captured, clarified, and organized onto your action lists and calendar. You’ve already deemed these important, so make them a high priority. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Work that shows up</span></b>: This is the work that comes up unexpectedly throughout the day—when your boss walks into your office and asks for a few minutes to chat or you get in your car and see the oil change light is on. Prioritize these tasks when they’re more important than your predefined work; otherwise, put them in your in-tray. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Defining your work</span></b>: This is the time you spend clarifying and processing everything in your in-tray and organizing it into the appropriate places. Prioritize time to do this during your Weekly Review. </div></li></ol><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">People often prioritize work that shows up by default, just doing what’s in front of them and seemingly urgent. But that approach leaves them feeling behind</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">, not in control, and bothered by every interruption.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">By contrast, if you regularly invest time in defining your work and have an organized system of predefined work, you can make well-informed choices about which task to engage in at any time. This benefit plays out in a few ways:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When work that shows up is truly urgent and must be addressed immediately, you’re aware of the predefined work that you’re delaying. This puts you in a better position to make specific plans to still get everything done on time, as opposed to feeling frustrated and anxious because you only have a general sense that there are other things you need to be doing. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Having a reliable system for intaking, defining, and organizing work gives you peace of mind that you can put a hold on what you’re doing to deal with the work that shows up and easily come back to it later, or that you can put the work that shows up in your in-tray and know that you’ll get it done on time. </span></div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Being aware of the items on your calendar and action list prevents you from overlooking or neglecting items until they “show up” as emergencies </span></b>when their deadlines arrive. </div></li></ul><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">The Six-Level Model of Prioritizing</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">We’ve talked about frameworks to weigh out the tasks in front of you. It’s also critical that you </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">keep your commitments and work in balance with your bigger-picture goals, values, and responsibilities. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">If your boss asks you to chair a committee at work, it may seem important until you stop and consider whether devoting your time and energy to that helps you achieve your professional goals.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Think of this model as a six-story building: The ground floor deals with the daily grind while the top floor gives you the best view into the distance.</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ground is current actions </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 1 is current projects</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 2 is your roles and responsibilities </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 3 is your short-term (one- to two-year) goals</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 4 is your long-term goals</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 5 is your life purpose and guiding principles</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In order to keep your ground floor in line with your highest horizons, consider this example:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Action (Ground): You have a phone call to make for work. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Project (Horizon 1): The call is about a deal you’re trying to make. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Responsibility (Horizon 2): This deal would increase the company’s sales.</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Short-term goal (Horizon 3): Making the deal would earn you major points with your boss. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Long-term goal (Horizon 4): This success would likely lead to a promotion. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Life (Horizon 5): A promotion will put you in a position that allows you to have the career and lifestyle you want. </span></div></li></ul><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you know that your relatively small to-do is helping you move in the direction you ultimately want to go in life, it helps you stay motivated, productive, and stress-free.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> By contrast, when you feel like you’re spinning your wheels and spending your time on tasks that don’t benefit you, it is stressful, frustrating, and anxiety-inducing.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Work From the Bottom Up</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">It might seem logical to determine your priorities from the top-down—decide your life purpose, use that to define your goals, create or commit to responsibilities that move you toward those goals, and then identify projects and actions within those responsibilities. However, in practice, it’s more realistic to work from the bottom-up because </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">getting in control of the actions in front of you frees up your mind to think about projects, which leads to higher thinking</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> about your responsibilities, and so on.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">(Shortform note: This is similar to the principle behind psychologist Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which states you can’t attend to your higher-level needs—including a sense of belonging and self-esteem—until you’ve met your basic needs for food, water, shelter, and safety.)</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Follow these guidelines to work through everything from the bottom-up:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Ground: Keep your action lists complete and current so you’re grounded in the knowledge of your immediate tasks. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 1: Keep your Projects list complete (review the tips in Chapter 7 for identifying hidden projects). This gives you a snapshot of your workload and helps you make decisions week to week. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizon 2: Make a checklist of your various roles (for example, parent, manager, activist, individual) and consider making sublists with your responsibilities associated with each role. You don’t need to review these checklists weekly, but review them regularly and </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">look out for potential projects to improve within your roles and responsibilities</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Horizons 3-5: While the first few horizons deal with the present, the higher horizons deal with your future, including career planning, business strategy, and life direction. Assessing these horizons will be a more personal, introspective process in which you might as yourself:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">What are your long-term <i>professional </i>goals, and what current projects work toward those goals? What are your long-term <i>personal </i>goals, and what current projects work toward those goals?

However, even with the project planning steps we talked about in Chapter 3, you might need to do some deeper vertical thinking for certain projects.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Review your Projects list and ask yourself these questions about each project:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Is there more I need to know about this? </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Are there ideas or information I need to capture? </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">What else do I need to remember about this project? </span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">As you go through this process, jot down your thoughts in whatever form feels best—bullet points, an outline, or a mind map.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">While many projects are straightforward and take just a few steps to complete (such as finding a new doctor), there are two types of projects that need more attention:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Projects that are still on your mind after you’ve decided the next action</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Projects that inspire plans and ideas that pop up at random times</span></div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Let’s look at how to deal with each.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Type #1: Projects That Need More Planning</span></span></h3><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you’ve decided on a next action for a project but it’s still nagging at you, you probably need to do more planning.</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">For these projects, your next action will most likely take one of four forms:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Brainstorming</span></b>: If you need more ideas to get things moving on the project, the action item will be along the lines of “Draft ideas for Project X.” Decide how you’re going to brainstorm (refer to Chapter 3) and put the action on the appropriate list—possibly the “Computer Tasks” if you’re going to type up your ideas. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Organizing</span></b>: If you already have some notes or support materials that you need to sort and organize, your action item will be something like “Organize Project X notes.” Again, determine the context for this action and put it on the “Office,” “Computer Tasks,” or other appropriate action list.</div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Setting up meetings</span></b>: If you need input from other people involved to brainstorm or determine how to move forward, you’ll have to set up a meeting and your action item might be “email team” or “send meeting request.” </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Gathering information</span></b>: If you need more information about how to move forward, decide how you’ll get that data (for example, talking to someone, reviewing documents, or doing online research) and create your action item accordingly. </div></li></ol><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Type #2: Capturing Random Thoughts</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you’re working on a big project like planning a conference or a vacation, you’ll get ideas at random times—when you’re making dinner, driving to pick up your kids from school, or watching TV. Don’t lose these ideas or let them float around your head taking up space.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Be diligent about capturing project ideas in any way you can</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">, whether you jot them down on paper, make a note in a phone app, or text or email the idea to yourself. Then, make sure each one gets into your in-tray.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">From there, if the idea is an action item then put it on the appropriate list. If it’s simply an idea you want to revisit later, put it with your project support materials or another logical location based on your organization system.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Stock the Right Tools</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Having the right tools readily accessible facilitates—even inspires—your creative thinking.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the paper-based physical world, you’ll want to have:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Good writing tools—pens, pencils, or markers—at each location you’re likely to take notes (such as your office, your desk at home, and your briefcase)</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Loose-leaf paper (lined and/or graph) or notepads, preferably with perforated pages that can be ripped out and added to your in-tray</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">A whiteboard and/or easel pad to give you a large space to brainstorm, especially if you’re working with others</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">File folders to create a physical project file as soon as you have something to put in it</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">For digital planning and brainstorming, consider using:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Word processing software</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Mind-mapping software</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Outlining software</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Presentation software</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Spreadsheet software</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Note-taking apps</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Additional computer screens to give you more space to brainstorm and organize (this gives you the same freedom as a whiteboard or easel pad)</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keep two caveats in mind when you use digital tools: First, make sure you’re comfortable using the software or app, so that you can focus more on your planning than the technology. Second, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">be as diligent about purging and updating your digital records as you are with your paper files</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">; just because you have unlimited space to keep lots of documents and notes doesn’t mean that you should.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">While digital devices offer ever-increasing options for planning and organizing, plus the benefit of being portable and easily accessible, you’ll probably still benefit from using a combination of paper and digital tools. Paper generally makes it easier to draw and write in a less structured format, which offers valuable freedom for creative thinking.</span></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>21</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Part 3 | Chapter 11: The Life-Changing Habit of Capturing </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now that you know the principles and the practice of the Getting Things Done program, let’s talk about how implementing this system will change your mental well-being and relationships with others.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Capturing Liberates Your Mind</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Capturing everything you need to do in one system maximizes your mental capacity: When you hold everything in your head, relatively unimportant tasks consume as much mental energy as the important ones, so some items are getting too much attention and others aren’t getting enough. By contrast, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">when you capture and clarify everything, you can assess how important and urgent something really is and address it appropriately. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The initial capturing process might bring up conflicting feelings: The sheer number of tasks can make you anxious, stressed, frustrated, and guilty. But recording and organizing them will also make you feel relieved and in control.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You’ll know you’ve captured everything when you have nothing left pulling at your attention. At this point you can put all your focus on the task at hand and get into a “zone” with everything you do.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Capturing Makes You Trustworthy</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When people around you—at work and in your personal life—see that you consistently and promptly act on items and tasks, their trust in you will grow. In simple terms, think about a friend who always cancels or reschedules your lunch dates at the last minute versus a friend who always shows up or gives you ample notice when she can’t make it; who do you trust more, and does that trust extend beyond the ability to show up for lunch?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">By the same token, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">when you reliably follow the system and stay on top of your tasks, projects, and organization, you’ll have more trust in <i>yourself</i> and you’ll become more confident about the way you engage with the world. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Every time you take on a new task, you’re making an agreement with yourself. And every unfinished task on your to-do list feels like a broken agreement; too many unfinished tasks causes you to lose trust in yourself.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keep your trust and confidence in yourself high with these strategies:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Don’t make the agreement.</span></b> Many people have a habit of taking on commitments that aren’t that important to them because they underestimate how much they already have on their plate. The capturing process makes you more consciously aware of your workload, so you can make well-informed decisions about whether or not to make future agreements. Make fewer commitments to reduce your stress. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Complete the task. </span></b>To get rid of the nagging feeling you have about a task, just <span style="font-family: inherit;"><i>do it</i></span>. You’ll get it off your list and off your mind, plus you’ll get a psychological boost from the feeling of accomplishment, which will jump-start momentum to complete more tasks. Although it can be overwhelming, seeing everything you’ve captured on a list might actually inspire you to get moving. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Renegotiate the agreement. </span></b>As soon as you make an agreement with yourself that you’re going to do something, your brain constantly feels like you should be doing that thing right now—even when you’re not consciously thinking about the task, it’s occupying part of your mental energy and attention. However, if you put the task on your Someday/Maybe list or put a reminder on your calendar, you’ve renegotiated the agreement and your brain can rest at ease knowing that you’ve committed to revisit the thought later. </div></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">There’s almost always more to do (or more options of things to do) than can possibly be done, so it’s critical that you learn to filter all the demands on your time by eliminating some agreements and renegotiating others.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Organizational Efficiency Stems From a Culture of Capturing</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When a couple, company, team, or family has a culture of consistent and reliable capturing, it makes the whole organization run more smoothly because no one has to worry about anyone else letting something slip through the cracks.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Many organizations don’t run as smoothly as they can because of hindered communication and action. This can happen when:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">People don’t have in-trays </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">People verbally agree to do things but don’t capture them in any form</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">People allow items sit unprocessed in their in-trays for too long</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">People are diligent about checking and responding to some modes of communication (such as emails) but not others (such as voicemails) </span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">However, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">everyone in the organization benefits from a culture of capturing tasks as they come in.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Even families function better when every member has her own in-tray.</span></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>22</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Chapters 12 and 13: The Life-Changing Habit of Next Actions </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Defining a next action goes hand-in-hand with identifying and envisioning the outcome you want to achieve:</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> If you don’t know where you’re going, you can’t decide how to get there.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> The Getting Things Done program helps you determine both the outcomes you want via projects and how to achieve them via next actions.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Identifying projects and next actions brings clarity, accountability, productivity, and empowerment. You define the outcome you want, determine who’s involved in making it happen, create momentum that contributes to achieving this outcome, and take on ownership of making this dream a reality.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Your Mind Turns Undecided Next Actions Into Daunting Tasks</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you have the opportunity to tackle things on your to-do list, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">one of the biggest roadblocks to productivity is not having next actions already defined. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Why do so many smart, successful people delay working on projects until they’re pushing the deadline? Intelligent, creative, and sensitive people tend to procrastinate the most because when they look at a task like “do taxes,” their imaginative minds conjure worst-case-scenario images.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you’re not in the habit of defining next actions, your whole to-do list becomes overwhelming. When that happens, it’s tempting to avoid it entirely.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Instead, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">clarifying next actions turns seemingly daunting tasks into bite-sized actions you can easily complete and feel the thrill of success.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> Taking it a step further and categorizing next actions into context-specific lists removes yet another barrier to tackling your to-do list and feeling on top of the world.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clarifying a next action usually only takes about 10 seconds, but on a Thursday afternoon when you have 15 minutes before your next meeting, you might not feel like you have the brainpower to figure out the next action for an item that says “get new tires.” On the other hand, seeing “search the web for a tire store” feels much more doable.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">The Benefits of Asking, “What’s Next?”</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Too often, people come away from meetings or discussions knowing only that something generally needs to happen, but they have no clarity on the next action or who’s responsible for it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Always decide the next action</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">—and force that decision in group settings—</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">to boost productivity by committing to progress from the start instead of waiting until you’re up against a deadline. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Besides increasing your chances of making progress on a task, there are several benefits to simply asking the question, “What happens next, and who’s responsible?”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">First, the question brings clarity. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you decide the next action, you also have to decide whether it’s worth your time, energy, and resources.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> You must decide if you’re serious about making this happen, and if you know what you’re getting into.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Second, the question brings accountability. You know the next action; now who’s going to do it? Many companies’ collaborative cultures make it easy to avoid assigning responsibility or blame, but someone needs to be tasked with the action in order for it to get done.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Third, the question brings productivity. It’s harder to avoid doing a specifically defined action than a vague project. Plus, you’re going to get more done if you have a plan of attack for everything from the get-go, instead of consistently scrambling to finish projects before their deadlines.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Finally, the question brings empowerment. </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Asking what you need to do next gives you ownership and assumes that you have the power to make progress on a project. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Furthermore, when you complete that action on your own time and of your own accord—instead of being forced under fire—you feel more in control and get a greater feeling of success from the accomplishment.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Applying GTD Principles to Organizations</span></span></h3><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">The practices of the GTD system are equally applicable to organizations and can profoundly increase productivity and alter an organization’s culture</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> from one of high stress and constantly putting out fires to one of efficient and productive problem-solving.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Although you can’t force each individual to adopt new habits, you can offer training to educate them and support them in implementing the practices. Have people in the organization who have already mastered the methods to both support others and lead by example.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Small factors—including unfocused meetings and neglected in-trays—can lead to major slow-downs and backlogs in productivity. By the same token, implementing even some small aspects of the GTD system can produce significant results.</span></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>23</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Exercise: Decide Your Next Move </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Getting through your tasks boils down to determining the next actions for each item on your to-do list.</span></div><hr><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">What is a task or project—big or small—that you’ve been putting off?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If you have a list or organizer where you keep things like this, have you listed this item as a project or as the next action?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">If your entry doesn’t reflect an actual physical action, take a moment to clarify what the next action is.

However, by the time the updated version was released in 2015, multiple cognitive science studies had confirmed the principles behind the GTD methodology.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The GTD system offers more than just a way to manage your time and your tasks—</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">GTD encourages more meaningful work, a more mindful approach to living, and an overall sense of empowerment and reduced stress</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> through outcome thinking (projects) and longer-term goals (higher horizons).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Several psychological theories and principles that back up GTD practices, including:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Research on </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">distributed cognition</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> proves that your brain is great at thinking and having ideas, but not great at remembering them. </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Studies show that unfinished goals, actions, and projects (a.k.a. open loops) weigh heavily on your mind, decreasing your clarity and ability to focus. </span></div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Self-leadership strategies</span></b> help people control their own actions with techniques such as self cueing (such as adding items to your action lists), natural rewards (such as the sense of accomplishment from completing captured tasks), and positive mindset (such as feeling motivated and empowered). <b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Self-leadership strategies are proven to increase people’s sense of self-efficacy</span></b>, the feeling of confidence and control over your ability to perform tasks. </div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Research shows that the most effective way to achieve goals is through implementation intentions, or making a plan that includes the necessary actions and the contexts for completing them.</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Let’s take a closer look at two other areas of psychological study that support the GTD system.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Experience Total Focus Through Flow</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Flow is the state of being totally engaged and performing at your peak; athletes call it being “in the zone.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The GTD program facilitates several conditions that are necessary to experience flow:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You must be working on just one activity.</span></b> The goal of GTD is to clear your mind so you can focus on one task at a time. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You must have clear goals in mind. </span></b>The GTD system requires you to define projects, desired outcomes, and next actions, so you know the purpose behind each activity you engage in. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You must receive some form of feedback.</span></b> The GTD program helps you see and track your progress on your actions and projects lists, which is a form of feedback. </div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">When you achieve flow, you experience:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Total concentration</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">A sense of being in control</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Clarity of your goals</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Little to no self-consciousness</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">No sense of time</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Intrinsic motivation</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Once you’ve experienced flow, you’re likely to be drawn to repeat the activity.

Seeing all this in front of you gives you confidence that you know what you need to do and how to do it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">2) Optimism </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">is your positive feeling about your ability to succeed now and in the future.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The GTD system helps you track your progress on projects and actions, and every step forward you make gives you a psychological “win” that boosts your motivation and confidence in your future success.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">3) Hope </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">is your ability to work toward your goals, even when it means redirecting your paths to get there.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The GTD program emphasizes front-end decision-making by forcing you to identify projects and clarify next actions. This practice involves setting goals (identifying projects) and determining the paths to achieving them (clarifying next actions).</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">4) Resilience </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">is your ability to bounce back and persevere after encountering problems.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The GTD system aims to give you a sense of stress-free control over your life, and when you feel like you have a handle on everything in front of you you’ll be able to face challenges with more calm and clarity.</span></div><div><br></div><hr><h1><b>25</b></h1><div><br></div><div><b><span style="--en-markholder:true;"><br></span></b></div><h2><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;"> Chapter 15: Mastering the GTD Program </span></span></b></h2><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">As we’ve talked about, implementing and mastering the GTD program will be a lifelong endeavor—you’ll never reach an endpoint but rather, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">over time, you’ll become more proficient at using the GTD system and can leverage it to accomplish more profound productivity. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Think of it like learning to play guitar: First, you learn the chords, then, as those become more second-nature, you learn simple melodies, and finally, you can compose your own music.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Let’s explore the three tiers of GTD mastery.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Tier 1: The Fundamentals</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Like any skill, the first step to mastering the GTD system is to get a grasp of the basics.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Although the GTD program doesn’t require any new skills</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> (for example, you know how to write things down and file papers), </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">it does require you to adopt new practices and form new habits.</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> It can easily take about two years to cement these habits, and most people fall off the wagon and get back on course a couple of times along the way.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Don’t let these basic practices slip, since they&nbsp; cause your whole system to unravel:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Capturing items as soon as you receive them</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Diligently identifying next actions </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keeping your Waiting For list complete and current, regularly reviewing it, and determining follow-up next actions when necessary</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Maintaining Agenda lists with discussion topics for various people in your life</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Maintaining a simple and navigable filing system</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Writing only date-specific tasks and reminders on your calendar </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Committing to a Weekly Review</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Avoid these pitfalls and stay diligent about the GTD practices and you’ll reach the next level of GTD mastery.</span></div><div><br></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Tier 2: Effective Life Management</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">While Tier 1 gives you full control of your hourly and daily tasks and schedule, at Tier 2 you’re managing your life at a weekly and monthly level. In other words, Tier 1 is about mastering your next actions, while Tier 2 is about mastering your projects.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Once you have a handle on all your action items, you can focus on the reasons behind those actions—the projects. Your projects are tied to your various roles and responsibilities, so</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> this focus on Horizons 1 and 2 helps you ensure that every demand on your time aligns with your values and goals. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">You’ve achieved Tier 2 mastery when:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You have a complete and updated Projects list.</span></b> At this level, create a project to address anything that’s pulling at your attention, even relatively subtle and abstract issues like improving a relationship.&nbsp; </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You have a complete and current list of your roles, responsibilities, and interests</span></b> in all areas of your life. When you have and review this list, identify improvements you want to make within those roles and responsibilities and turn those into projects. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You’ve tailored the GTD system to fit your lifestyle, needs, and life direction</span></b> beyond daily tasks. At this point, you’ve internalized the practices and elements of the GTD system and use the system without thinking about it. </div></li><li><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">You respond to challenges in life by leaning more heavily on the GTD system</span></b>, rather than straying from it. You recognize that the GTD system allows you to handle unexpected challenges more effectively, and you’re no longer tempted to revert back to past habits. </div></li></ul><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 30px;">Tier 3: Optimization</span></span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">At Tier 3, you’re not just using the guitar to play someone else’s songs—you’re making your own music. At this level of mastery, you’re using the GTD system to optimize your life.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">There are two aspects of this optimization. First, you can dedicate time to things that are meaningful to you. At this point, your daily and weekly tasks are under control, freeing up both time and mental energy. Now,</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"> add pipedream items to your in-tray because you have the system to process and execute them. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Second, use your distraction-free mind to come up with creative new ideas and productive actions. Have you ever been sorting through old contacts and came across a name that made you think, “I should contact this person and update her about the work I’m doing now”? At this stage, you can actually do all those kinds of small actions that get easily pushed aside but have the potential to produce tremendous results.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">At this tier, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">come up with ways you can use the GTD system to not only manage but improve your life. </span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Rely on checklists to make sure your life is as well-rounded as you want it to be. Set reminders to check in on family members and touch base with old friends. Create a list of your most important professional contacts. Regularly review inspirational writings and affirmations.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Mastering the GTD program at this level goes beyond dealing with items that life presents to you and allows you to set your own agenda.</span></div><div><br></div><h4><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Create Checklists</span></span></b></h4><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Use checklists in two ways to further keep your mind clear and stress-free.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">First, </span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">create checklists for broad areas of your life—</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit;">like maintaining good physical health and keeping motivation and morale up among your team at work—</span><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">so that you can regularly review and confirm that you’re still attending to that priority. </span></b></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Checklist items like these often encompass items for your Projects list and Next Actions list (for example, creating an exercise regimen or planning a team-building activity), but as those particular tasks vary use your checklist to ensure you’re staying on top of things in that general area.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Consider creating checklists that pertain to these areas of your life:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Career goals</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Creative endeavors</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Family </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Finances </span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Health and well-being</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Relationships</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Second, you can use checklists to help you remember a sequence of steps or the various components of something, the way you would use a recipe. Examples of this include:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Instructions for fixing a recurring tech problem</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Job duties when you’re new to a position</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">All the steps of a new workflow you’re implementing</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Items to pack on every trip you take</span></div></li><li><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Everything you need to review and update during your Weekly Review</span></div></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Keep your checklists current and relevant by creating them and tossing them whenever appropriate.
